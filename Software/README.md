The Software comes in two versions.  
One with support for a RTC and one without.

With an RTC, the Filename contains the Date when the File was created.  

Without an RTC the Filename simply increments everytime a File is created, starting always from 0.
If you want to continue from an index, include an empty csv with the Format <DeviceID>_<Index>.csv.
